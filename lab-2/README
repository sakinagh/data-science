Overview

This project involves performing supervised Bayesian classification and model comparison using Weka. 
The dataset contains placement-related attributes for students, and the goal is to predict PlacementStatus using various classification techniques.

Steps to Reproduce

Dataset Preparation: The dataset was cleaned and converted into ARFF format using Weka's ARFF Viewer.
PlacementStatus was selected as the class attribute.

Feature Selection: Used Gain Ratio as the attribute evaluator and Ranker as the search method.
Top-ranked attributes include Extracurricular Activities, Projects, and Placement Training.

Model Training and Evaluation: Applied Na誰ve Bayes, J48, Random Forest, and OneR classifiers.
Compared models using 10-fold, 5-fold, and 20-fold cross-validation.

Findings: Random Forest without cross-validation achieved the highest accuracy (100%).
J48 with the Discretize filter provided the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.
Na誰ve Bayes performed well but was outperformed by decision trees.

To analyze the dataset in Weka:

Open Weka GUI.

Load weka_data.arff into the Explorer.

Navigate to the Classify tab and select a classifier.

Adjust settings as per the report and execute classification.

View evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.
